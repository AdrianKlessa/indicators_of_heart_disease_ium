### Heart Failure Prediction

This repository contains code for creating an ML model for predicting heart failure based on patients' general health information.

Created as part of a Machine Learning Engineering course, it contains Jenkinsfiles for automatic data cleaning, model training and evaluation.

A github action is also included. For simplicity, instead of downloading the dataset from Kaggle it uses a prepared git repostiory containing the dataset.
